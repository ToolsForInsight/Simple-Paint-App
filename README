# README for Simple-Paint-App

This application is a simple paint application that is written in Java, uses Applet technology, and is deployed using .jar.

This is my final project for the Java 3 course offered online through the O’Reilly School of Technology (yes, that O’Reilly).

Thanks for reading and using.
